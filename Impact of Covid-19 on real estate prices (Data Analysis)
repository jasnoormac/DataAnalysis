In the data analysis project focused on the impact of Covid-19 on real estate property rates in the Bay Area, I conducted a comprehensive analysis using Python. The project aimed to understand the relationship between the pandemic and the fluctuations in property rates.

To begin, I collected and preprocessed the data, which included real estate property rates and relevant Covid-19 statistics for the Bay Area. I performed data cleaning, handled missing values, and prepared the data for analysis.

Using Python's data analysis libraries, I conducted exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and statistical analysis to uncover patterns and trends. I examined how the property rates were affected during different phases of the pandemic, such as lockdowns, reopening, and vaccination drives. Additionally, I used regression techniques to quantify the impact of Covid-19 on property rates, considering other factors such as location, property type, and economic indicators.
